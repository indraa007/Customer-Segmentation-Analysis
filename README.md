In this project customers data was provided to us on that data we performed EDA operations to check null values, duplicates so it doesn not affect on our data.
After that done with data visualization part like boxplot, barplot, heatmap and applied some clustering techniques like Kmeans clustering and Dbscan clustering.
After that we used the supervised machine learning algorithms(Classification) to check which model is performing best for the given data.
After completing model building we started with model evaluation part to show accuracy for both training set and testing set and done bar graph also to show that difference.
And at last we done with model deployment to show the result on a web page as the number of clusters for entered data.
